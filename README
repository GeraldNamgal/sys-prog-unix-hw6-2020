README for hw 6

"In this file put a list of the files you are submitting with
a brief (four to ten words) description of each one." --

- Makefile            <-- the Makefile needed to run the program 
- Plan                <-- the plan for how my program will be implemented
- wsng.c              <-- the main program
- socklib.c           <-- contains functions for client/server programs
- socklib.h           <-- header file for socklib.c
- wsng.conf           <-- web server configuration file for wsng.c

"Also put any notes to the grader." --

    - To compile wsng, navigate to the directory with wsng.c and run "make" at
      the command line. Then to run it, the usage is "./wsng [-c CONFIG FILE]".
    - Besides adding the 500 server code error, I also added the 507 error per
      the HW questions
    - I added one more CGI environment variable in main() per the HW questions
    - I did not implement the error log from the last HW question
